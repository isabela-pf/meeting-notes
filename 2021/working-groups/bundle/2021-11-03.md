### Summary

#### Conda bundles

- We have a schema for menuinst on which we can build the cross-platform implementation. See PR here: https://github.com/conda/menuinst/pull/91
- While that's being digested by the community, we will build the bundle using a constructor stack fork (menuinst, conda-standalone, constructor). These involve three different packages that vendor each other (fun!), so I will keep our forks in our napari channel for now, under the label bundle_tools or similar. I am tracking this in https://github.com/users/jaimergp/projects/2.
  - This is only temporary until the Conda organization accepts the menuinst revamp. This will also allow conda-adjacent projects to implement the schema, so micromamba and the like can be used with constructor directly.
- I will also remind that we (will) have napari nightlies in anaconda.org/napari.

#### Apple dev license

- Ziyang working on getting the license with CZI, and we should have it pretty soon.
