### Summary

#### Conda bundles

New installers available. See -> https://github.com/napari/napari/actions/runs/1526575006
Now featuring conda activation in all platforms.

#### Menuinst

* Windows

Activation mechanism for windows did not previously account for activation scripts, so the process of activation had to be updated.

* Linux

Things work as expected so far, but more feedback is needed.

* OSX

Activation was not working because JRG uses micromamba and it has a slightly different activation syntax. New menuinst logic fixes this.

#### Napari Updates

* Update mechanism

PR in progress. https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3731

This adds a new Qmessage box with checkboxes, adds a new setting for checking updates on startup, and on the first napari run it will ask if this wants to be opt-in.

The process will check for new verison on conda-forge (for now) and if it is a new version it will prompt the user for downloading it in the background.

Another entry is added to the Help menu for triggering updates.

The install process is still not in place but it will be handled in a separate PR.
