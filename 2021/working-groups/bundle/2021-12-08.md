### Summary

#### Conda bundles

* Uninstaller for Windows should be able to clean up the shortcuts just fine (testing pending).
* Uninstallers for Mac and Linux, simple script to remove files and tell the user to delete the shortcut icon.
* PKG installer is now branded with custom text, needs some formatting still. Provides a log in case there's an error for reporting purposes.

#### Schedule

* Bundle functionally is almost there. Probably this week we can start testing.
* Should be ready by the end of the month. Need to check with Gonzalo on timing for the update-in-place feature. We can tentatively plan for adding the installation grid to napari.org in January.
* Still need to look into the Apple dev signing issue that shows an alert to the user. Jaime to look into this after uninstall.
