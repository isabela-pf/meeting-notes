### Summary

#### Conda bundles

We are still doing great work to add multiplatform shortcuts to the `conda` packaging. 

- This week we landed a milestone! [First Menuinst draft implementation finished!](https://github.com/conda/menuinst/pull/91). We can start testing and fixing rough edges.
- Working on enabling `conda` for the new menuinst [here](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/11035).
- Creating conda packages for the new building tooling [here](https://github.com/jaimergp-forge).
- Experimental packages will be uploaded to https://anaconda.org/napari
- The constructor/conda/menuinst relationship is intricate and they cross-vendor each other. Very fun. Uploaded PDF [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XNbKxPIwoburGx5NQUbEbONfRkGyiQz7/view?usp=sharing) in case it simplifies the explanation.
