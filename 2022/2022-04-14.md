# Napari developer meetings

## 2022-04-14

### This week's Agenda

- Isabela
    - the [PR for the alt text event](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4375) is up and open for review!
    - I'm still sorting my napari layer control sorting notes. But now there's [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RCHD4Wfb9D5Lf2eG_F-U4SgLTwtp_kLzudVJOysWW5Y/edit?usp=sharing) for you to see a work in progress.
- Andy: async slicing project plan
    - https://hackmd.io/YN6Qhu18QriV-rtVI6Pzog?view
- Draga: LFS update
    - briefly: keep using LFS for now while we come up with bandwidth to get rid of it
- Draga: file reading updates [#4390](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4390)
    - read 4390 to get an understanding of what's left for removing call order behaviour
    - need some decisions to be made
        - directories & filename_patterns (zulip discussion): how do we apply filename_patterns to directories (if at all)
        - one plugin can provide multiple readers, how does the command line user disambiguate between them when calling `viewer.open`
    
### Last week's Agenda
- Nick: Meeting cadence
    - With more meetings on the calendar and working group meetings holding many deep-dive discussions, there has been less on this agenda. Let's move this meeting to be fortnightly.
- Juan: home page update (from docs WG)
    - short PR with small text improvements over current "README" homepage
    - language following mission & values
    - follow-up PR(s) to align design with sklearn/matplotlib
- Draga: npe2 and consolidating viewer open behavior
    - need new npe2 release in order to test
- Ben: a bunch of astronomers heard about napari yesterday
- Juan: updates on labels rendering
    - Report from architecture working group
- Isabela: another update from [bundled app update UX](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4120#issuecomment-1079506010)
- Isabela: alt text workshops happened!
    - Find more on the [agenda](https://hackmd.io/vDsWUBqQSxW_7TNxF-RKKA)
    - If you feel like adding descriptions after, I leave the PR open for a week usually to clean it up and let people edit their own work.[The working PR if you'd like to add to it!](https://github.com/isabela-pf/napari/pull/2)
