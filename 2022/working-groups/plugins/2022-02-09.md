<!-- Discussion goes here-->

Ideas
- achievements in napari
    - is there any explicit `on_startup` code that runs or 
      is everything lazy
    - ideas
        - annotated 100 cells
    - kind of a fun way to get focused user stats
- colormaps
    - [Grzegorz] probably better to add a vispy/numpy api
    - [Matthias] discoverable colormaps in python in general
        - should there be a colormap provision standard
        - [Grzegorz] How to avoid collisions (multiple packages w the same gray)
- widget layout constraints
    - vertical stretch

Code that runs on startup
    - user grants permission on first time
    - scoped to just the start up event
    - can run async
    - for 
        - achievement idea
        - change behavior based on what other plugins are available
            - only populate a submenu if a specific colormap is present

Q: How much do we extend manifest vs napari api
