<!-- Discussion goes here-->

- npe2#136
    - we don't want to try as part of the plugin manager to try to manage the JVM.  Do want to keep it so python packages don't have to import napari-specific things to work as plugins.
    - Q: how do folks do this outside of the plugin ecossytem
    - could make a napari-jvm - kind of a blessed package
    - how to get the jvm using community to investigate the issue themselves
    - [ ] Ask curtis for specific solutions
    - [TL] re activation
        - order important? wrt napari init?
        - [MB] for plugins that want to init at startup, use opt in first time.
        - [NC] nice to have a safe mode
        - [ ] [MB] Create issue arround startup

- shim
    - roll out
        - ship w a disable flag
            - allows testing w+w/o behavior in the same version of napari
            - may run into problems w some monkeypatched plugins
            - [ ] helpful to remove npe1 reader call order preferences first (napari#4000)
    - Monkeypatching 
        - see napari-tools-menu
        - menu spec is driving the use

Priorities
- Menus
    - probably good to hit short term
        - nice to take care of Robert's needs
    - would be nice to tie to keybindings
    - would be nice to clean up napari menus/keybindings internally - make it more declarative overall
- Dock widgets
    - how to avoid exposing the whole napari api
        - used for plugin communication
        - maybe need to flush out command api
            - let plugins run other plugins commands
