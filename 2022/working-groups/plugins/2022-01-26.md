:::

* would like to tie enable/disable into [npe2#86]
* shim rough edges
    * can't bind to local closures
    * shim creates a morphism of the function generating name to encode the index. `def gen_hooks() => di: gen_hooks__npe1_shim_1` gets the function returned at index 1.
    * converted manifests are cached

* [Grzegorz] editable mode npe1 plugin via shim?
    * caching is a problem for editable installs
    * editable mode is detectable
    * avoid cache in that case

* Talley demoing
    * napari loads faster!

* [Matthias] what should invalidate the cache?
    * can use site packages metadata
        * look for package_version
        * don't cache if alpha or beta
    * uninstall will leave the cache artifact
        * could clean on napari directed uninstall
    * add a clear cache command
    * think about timestamp
    * check consistency when the plugin is actually loaded
    * if any errors occur invalidate cache

- make this optional in napari prefs, disabled by default, opt in for

* eventing
    * use psygnal to emit events from PluginManager
