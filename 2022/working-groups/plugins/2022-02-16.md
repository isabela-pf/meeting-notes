:::

- Trying to unify Path types
    - https://github.com/napari/npe2/issues/103
    - https://github.com/napari/npe2/pull/105
    - prefer moving to just list of str
    - probably have to end up with `Union[str,List[str]]`

- [ ] start reader redesign issue
    - would end up being a schema version change
    - should hit post shim
    
- Defining plugin states
    - activate = on import, gets context access
    - deactivate = cleanup, loose context
    - enable = figure it out champ (needs definition) 
    - disable = ignored for functionality, remove ui
    - register = we know of your manifest

- I don't remember: Is there any plan for napari-hub to have a search fields WRT wether a plugin uses npe2 and which version of teh manifest they have ? 
> [Nathan] yes^

- Andy went through "My first plugin" tutorial
    - [ ] Add to prereq's - need a working napari install for tutorial
