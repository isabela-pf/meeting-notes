- [Somi] Interested in web frontend for napari

plugin dependencies
-[Matthias] going down the direction of talking to conda or pypi and building a graphical dependency manager - not a short term thing.  It's a long term thing on the package manager itself.
    - need to run code to figure out dependencies for some things
        - pyprojecet.toml makes this better but
    - the problem is it's not just plugins


- [Matthias] when does a version go out of stability?
    - nudge on critical dependencies
    - napari follow nep#29
