- **Date:** 2022-04-20
- **Agenda**
    - [last week](https://hackmd.io/FJDjQLmlQKWKQI0nOUkLpA)
    - [npe2#149](https://github.com/napari/npe2/pull/149) PluginManifest.properties
    - [menu ideas w juan](https://hackmd.io/pBiPHwF1SPWHR68h9XwUwQ)
        - - [Juan] [npe2#153](https://github.com/napari/npe2/issues/153) event callbacks
    - [Andy]: input arguments to plugin functions:
        - e.g. a "float_format" argument to a reader, "compression_level", etc
        - possible motivation: napari#2288
        - as a setting vs as a kwarg
        - any objections to adding a non-required kwarg to a built-in?
    - [Draga] [napari#4358] weird zarr stuff and npe2 reader handling of directories (iter_readers)
- **Participants:**
:::

<!-- Discussion goes here-->

## Next steps
<!-- Action items go here -->

- [Talley]: contact Curtis Rueden (and Gabriel Selzer) to move forward with adding JVM classpath to plugin schema.
- [Talley]?, [Juan]?, [SomeoneElse]?: drive forward basic menus (maybe without context keys?)
    - small set of valid menus uniquely identified by name, and manifest declares this
    - some menu items may be commands (not widgets), so may need to use context keys to define if they are enabled? or may be able to just inspect the signature?
- [Andy]: small PR for float_format
    - use this as a driver for persisted plugin settings/preferences
    - write up snap-to-grid issue


## Notes 
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->
- properties/configuration
    - driving issue here is JVM initialization
        - if multiple plugins initialize through something like jpype or scyjava
    - possible options
        - merge this PR: general key/value store that could be used by plugins that need JVM
            - pro: configuration is not made for this
            - con: loose typing/schema makes this unclear
            - con: may not be able to serialize
            - con: this doesn't seem to solve the problem - napari would have to look for some specific key
        - generic support for initialization of various libraries with stronger typing?
        - define a napari-java/jvm plugin that other good plugins depend on
        - just inform plugins to depend on scyjava?
        - specific manifest entry for JVM classpath
    - likely go with specific manifest entry for JVM classpath
    
- menu ideas
    - may need to extend the context keys
        - e.g. LayerListContextKeys
    - menu is a more challenging usage that might require parametric constraints
    
- it is possible to reuse npe2 today next to napari (measurement engine, to allow register own measurement functions)?
    - no
        
- writer settings/parameters
    - two options
        - 1. access global settings/preferences for the plugin
        - 2. show a dock widget when there are optional kwargs
