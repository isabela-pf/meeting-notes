### Summary

- There's movement on the NAP! Hooray! 
- Reviewing 2022 Julyâ€“December timeline for work. Question: What does the "Collect feedback on user installation experience" section include concretely?
    - Jaime: This was more about making sure we address the feedback we've gotten via issues and actively watching for this feedback (even if it's not labeled `bundle`). It's an ongoing reminder instead of a single, additive task.
    - Where does the NAP fit in this timeline? What is and isn't blocked by it?
    - How do we measure some of these tasks? 
    - Can we confirm that all that is written is accurate and clear if someone reads it with no other context?
- Disucssion on OKRs and high level milestones
    - aligned on having 5 milestones, NAP approval + 4 features per roadmap
    - group thought it would be good to have 3 KRs around installation, update in place, plugin installation
