### Summary

- Laura's bug report!
    - Waver (?) issue closes the app in Windows; causes a warning in Mac
    - Add layers creates a warning in Mac
    - Are there links to these?
- Jaime
    - we might need to pin more strictly (we don't want to modify napari dependencies that might be already in memory)
    - some issues found with plugins might be metadata related/dependencies related.
    - Open issue for logging for both errors and conda commands with debug log level
    - Need feedback on https://github.com/conda-forge/napari-feedstock/pull/32
- Gonzalo:
    - Checks we need to add automatically in a separate repo:
        - Installability
        - Loadability
        - Unit test
- Isabela's design check in
    - Is Isabela blocking anything? No :)
    - [napari/napari #4074 Use napari hub api to list plugins](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4074) has been merged, but we would like the design feedback unaddressed on the PR to be its own issue so we return to it. (Action: Isabela to create issue)
    - [napari/napari #4120 UX/UI workflow for bundles updates](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4120) has been pushed out of this release cycle for time, so it can still be worked on.
        - Another round of mockups coming soon? :)

- Review/update project board
