### Summary

* PR is out of WIP and ready for review

#### Conda bundles

* Discussed using conda forge and not supporting Pypi/pip for the bundle
  * Should we support use cases of installing non-public plugins?
  * napari hub uses meta data from Pypi. In the short term, it will be rare for a plugin to be on conda forge and not pypi so we should be fine, but we can have a backup, maybe adding meta data to conda forge.
