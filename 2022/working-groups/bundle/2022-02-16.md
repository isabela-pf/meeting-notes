### Summary

#### UX workflows

##### Updates 

- How and when do users update (or get notified of needing an update) from the bundled application?
- Isa: Exploring options of where we can inform the user about this.

##### Compatible plugins

- How do we notify users of which plugins they cannot install (based on napari version, dependency conflicts)
- Isa: Do we have access to the actual issues?
- Add a one liner plus a hover popup with a link. Open an issue for the docs with the content of these docs.

#### Define package constraints

#### Napari projects separate envs

#### Licenses

- Have a legal page on licenses that come from a bundle.

#### Packages state

48 dependencies

#### Conda constructor
