### Summary
 - Need to write plugin developer guidelines and tools

#### Workflows

 - Experimental workflows
 - Drag and drop
 - Worry: Many napari plugins will never reach napari-hub or pypi.
 - Most of the devs do not care if the package s used or not by others
 - How can we motivate more devs/scientists to publish their things?

#### March release
Target features:
- New conda bundle
- At least 80% of packages migrated to Conda forge
- Update in place (may be clunky)

#### TODO

- Separate base environment from napari environment in bundle
- Define constraints (extra metapackage?) for conda versions
- Install plugins in the same env as napari
- When a new update appears, attempt to install plugins (with run dry) Otherwise try to install them 1 by 1
- Add record of plugin installation in order in the settings

#### Conda forge package pandemonium!

 - ~140 plugins to migrate
 - 72 plugins to migrate with dependencies already in conda-forge (PRs openned already)
 - 68 plugins to migrate with dependencies that need to be built in conda-forge
 - ~60 extra dependencies (a few might be tricky or not needed at all)
 - couple of weeks to go around 80% of packages (should be good enough for bundle release)
