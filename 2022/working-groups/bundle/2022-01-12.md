### Summary

#### Documentation

* We should probably have an installation tutorial. Justine will reach out to the Doc Working Group to see if they'll be able to create it.
    * Follow up: Justine surfaced this in the community meeting. There is an existing tutorial that Draga made that could be updated. The Docs WG can take this on.

#### Conda bundles
* Added support for RTF text: we can have links to licenses in the website
* Audited the licenses in the bundle: we have several GPL projects
* Changed default installation paths:
    * macOS: ~/Library/napari-x.y.z
        * Shortcuts under ~/Applications
    * Windows: ~/AppData/Local/napari-x.y.z
        * Shortcuts in desktop and start menu
    * Linux: ~/.local/napari-x.y.z
        * Shortcuts in canonical location for X11 standards, compatible with GNOME and KDE
* Will mark the PR to non WIP soon
* Still need Windows cert
* Unblocked with Apple authorization step for now - getting an unexpected error
