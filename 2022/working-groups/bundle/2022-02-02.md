### Summary

 - Need to write plugin developer guidelines and tools
 - Writes something on these lines https://focalplane.biologists.com/2021/09/04/collaborative-bio-image-analysis-script-editing-with-git/

#### Workflows

 - Experimental workflows
 - Drag and drop
 - Worry: Many napari plugins will never reach napari-hub or pypi.
 - Most of the devs do not care if the package s used or not by others
 - How can we motivate more devs/scientists to publish their things?
