        - Answered questions to 
            - 1) remove the "Notify before updating" option from preferences 
            - 2) Make the success dialog into a notification, keep errors as dialogs, and add copyable info as a drawer for errors 
            - 3) Keep the release notes as a link 
            - 4) When updating on quit, a failed update will keep napari open with an error dialog and a successful update will quit that version of napari 
            - 5) When update is in progress, add estimated time remaining (if possible) or the steps it's performing so that the user is informed of update progress
