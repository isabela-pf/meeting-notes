### Summary

#### UX review with Isabela (01/13/22)

* Positive. Given the technical constrains of the Installer libraries on MacOS, notifications are a good compromise to report progress to the user in a non-invasive way.
* Investigate if adding a :package: emoji helps with visual identification of the notification.
    * Looks good!
* Investigate possibilities for persistent notifications. Can notifications for processes that we know will take longer than five seconds last longer than the default?
    * Timeout not configurable from the script; it's a user setting we don't have access to.
* Punctuation: single sentences ending in period. Google's [Notices](https://developers.google.com/style/notices) section does use periods for single sentence things
