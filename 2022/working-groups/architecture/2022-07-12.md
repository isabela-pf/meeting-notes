### Agenda

- Andy: async slicing diagrams
    - Include thumbnail (both generating async and setting on main thread)
    - Consider mutating slice input state on main thread before slicing starts on other thread
        - Consistency between this state and dims state is more important than consistency between slicing input and output.
    - Clarify difference between `Layer.events.set_data` and `Layer.events.data`
    - Recent contribution that affects selection: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4809
        - This is not a plugin, but a community that we should either not break or have an easy way to reimplement

### Action items

- Andy: update diagrams with feedback
- Andy: in NAP, draw attention to the state of Dims (e.g. current_step). Should it reflect the latest request or the latest response?
