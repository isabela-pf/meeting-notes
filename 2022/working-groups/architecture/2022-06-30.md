### Agenda

- Jordao: graph layer
    - motivation: tracks layer is slow for loading and mutation
    - motivation: want/need for spatial graph layer
    - how to handle layer features?
        - layer feature index is always rangeindex
        - napari-graph: data structures
        - graph layer type
            - would use napari-graph
            - spatial graph
            - initially only need features for nodes
        - how to slice ND graphs?
            - prob slice the nodes like points
        - base class for points, vectors, graph
            - good to share code
        - current data: 1 million nodes
            - problems with tracks layer
            - how to scale with more? unsure yet
        - would igraph be a good alt to networkx
            - maybe too many dependencies?
- Kim: async slicing vectors
    - diagrams to show types + functions in prototype
    - moves some logic from vispy layer on_data_change to get_slice
    - try to remove more reference to self and mutation
    - question: why reverse the coordinates when passing to vispy
        - xyz vs zyx
- Andy: NAP progress


### Action items

- Andy: make updates to the detailed description, and sanity check that the design works in proto-type
- Kim: share the arch diagrams
- Eric: share progress of shapes + diagram
