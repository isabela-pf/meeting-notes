### Agenda

- Review action items from last time.
- [Eric]: OpenGL 4.1 on macOS
    - (effort to fix [#4005](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4005))
    - side benefit: better understanding of how to config an opengl context with qt before any windows are open
    - also better understanding of how to config a GLSL version with vispy
- [Greg]: potentially discuss permutation transforms in next meeting
- [Andy]: present draft layer / async project proposal
    - clarify tasks, stories, and requirements
    - all items are big
    - how much have we implemented right now?
        - not much (but there is experimental code and prototype)
        - do not drive that forward too much right now
    - many of the items are inter-related
    - prototypes can help reveal unexpected side-effects
    - tightening the requirements (being more specific)
        - examples from other existing software
        - separating out API from GUI
        - clarifying which layer types are supported for each goal
    - when should UX design become involved
        - late? because we roughly know what we need to support
        - but could do some design background research in parallel based on other software
    - OKRs
        - performance: objective is around monitoring, not necessarily improvement, so not an immediate driver here (but could help us understand performance effects of this work)
        - streaming video: may influence the design here
        
- [Nathan]: step through existing code
    - prototypes
        - DataSource: implements layer data protocol
        - next steps: points instead of image
        - example script outside of napari (i.e. no modification of napari core required)
            - add_image
            - Image.__init__
            - ImageBase.__init__
            - Image._set_view_slice 
                - VispyImageLayer._on_data_change
            - ImageBase._on_data_loaded
                - takes ImageSliceData
            - ImageSlice
                - these types of classes are to handle octree, but do trivial things when it's disabled
            - ImageLoader
                - load: checks if data has loaded
                    - calls if it has ImageSliceData.load_sync()
                - called by ImageSlice.load
                - called by ImageBase._load_slice
                    - emits ImageBase.loaded (connected to vispy tiled image layer and QtViewer related experimental polling)
            - ImageSliceData
                - required modification to make futures work
                - image is filled out (e.g. on load)
        - we only want to load data that we are looking at
            - data source could be infinitely large
            - separate out lazy loading of only the data we need, and async
    - Philip has a fancier executor about being efficient about dealing with requests
        
### Action items

- [Eric]: needs to create an issue devoted to just macOS OpenGL 4.1
- [Jun]: set up a meeting to go through use cases and get more specifics
