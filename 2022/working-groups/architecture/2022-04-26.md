### Agenda

- [Greg]: Permutations: Crashing on multi-scale; tests added. [#4303](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4303)
- [Eric]: Async updates: Eric & Andy progressing; prototype & performance tests to simulate network delay.
    - [Juan]: Suggested demo application: https://github.com/jni/napariboard-proto
- [Eric/Juan]: Label shaders [#3308](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3308):
    - Labels and "categorical data" are basically shoe-horned together right now with various side-effects (from fixing [#4321](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4321)).
    - Labels shader PR still doesn't fix https://github.com/napari/product-heuristics-2020/issues/38... why?
