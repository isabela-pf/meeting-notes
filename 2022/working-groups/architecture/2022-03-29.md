### Agenda

- Properties progress update
- Andy: TextManager/StringEncoding PR
    - https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4198
    - Decision: for the color encoding regarding color field, ok to break current API in future (i.e. no need for color_encoding)
    - Decision: OK to make things immutable for now, but want mutability later.
        - May need to revisit transferring connections.
    - Decision: _apply is OK as an alternative for _update
    - Decision: OK to remove hidden utility methods that are exposed publicly through imports
- Andy: review async motivation
    - https://napari.org/guides/rendering-explanation.html
    - performance and async docs too
    - do we agree with the high level comments/motivation here? particularly in performance? yes
    - is it just the current design that we don't like? or we think some of these concerns are fringe or don't reach many users
- Eric: observations from label layer hacking with Juan
    - Consequences of "labels are just a colormap"
    - [#4321](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4321), [#3308](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/3308)
