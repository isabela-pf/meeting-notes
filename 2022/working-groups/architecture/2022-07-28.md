### Agenda

- Andy: nap draft review
    - abstract: rewrite this now that doc is pretty complete
        - summarize motivation, design
        - move some things out (e.g. detail about image and points)
    - `Dims.current_step`: represent last response or last request
        - if it is the last response, that seems to force us into making the model synchronous (for now) because mutating current_step must wait to be consistent with that logic
        - lean towards making the model async, so that current_step represents the last request. Also consider adding the equiv of current step but for the last response (e.g. drawing some overlay that is dependent on the value).
    - Other things that trigger slicing
        - Changing a layer's data, transform parameters, Points.face_color.
        - +1 for single path for anything that triggers slicing.
        - Not against a sync refresh, but that should use the same path and wait.
    - async diagram: add something to explain that Qt main event loop can continue doing stuff
