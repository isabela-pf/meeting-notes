### Agenda

- Andy: NAP PR discuss/approve
    - Have experimented with sync as default, async when driving through GUI
    - Difficult to handle zoom/pan changes, which can cause reslicing because they are connected to vispy canvas draw events which can be caused by many things
    - Proposal: async by default first, add something like `Viewer.sync_slicing` context manager to allow users to force sync slicing publicly.
    - If we can untangle direct API calls vs. GUI actions, then I'd be fine with sync by default
    - Release schedule conversation
        - Considering switching to a more explicit semver
    - Layer data source: how will this potential refactor affect structure and naming?
        - May make incremental progress towards this as part of this project
        - Most names should be private, so can change later
        - Some inconsistency between coupling of vispy node data and single value attributes (e.g. colormap vs. opacity). Shapes layer is an example where this is complicated.
        
- Alister: transforms
    - separate affine and component-wise can be confusing (even with existing docstrings)
    - idea: model with explicit control of components with stateful system of actions (e.g. setting center of rotaton)
    - Andy: I think some API changes and incremental changes are viable for 0.5

### Action items

- Andy: update the NAP, open on main repo
- Alister: find transform related issues and follow up there
