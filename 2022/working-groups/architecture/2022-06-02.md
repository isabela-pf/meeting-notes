### Agenda

- Revisit action items
- Andy: present rough async slicing ideas and prototypes
    - https://hackmd.io/YN6Qhu18QriV-rtVI6Pzog?view#Detailed-description
    - plugin usage that connects to model events may rely on that being emitted on the main thread (e.g. QWidget update)
    - where to store sliced/sampled data (need it for things like get_value)
    - status bar update and others depend on sliced state
    - should we infer if we do sync or async slicing?
        - e.g. check type or size of data and guess if it will be fast
        - or measure dynamically
    - may be worth ensuring there is a swappable backend when dealing with qt/vispy specific issue (e.g. ensuring that things run on main thread)
