### Agenda

- Andy: nap draft review
    - add args and rvalues to async sequence diagram
    - add future work regarding ASAP updates (including # slicing threads)
- Andy: would community be open to start refactoring layer state?
    - Separate state out into things associated with what is sometimes called DataSource (e.g. `data, _transforms, features, face_color`), slice input(e.g. `_ndisplay`, `_dims_point`), and slice output (`_slice`, `__indices_view`).
    - Would explicitly help us understand what is dependent on this state.
    - Simple refactor: no public API change, should be no performance hit, could do it by layer type.
    - Should help us understand how we could remove this state.
    - Also helps with async slicing because we need to encapsulate and/or guard/lock this state.
