### Agenda

- Review action items from last time
- Maybe capture some use cases for the async project
    - need to pay attention to scrubbing with sliders
        - even with smaller datasets
    - large point sets (e.g. example in community meeting)
        - see zulip for example data set?
    - synthetic datasets may be useful here too
        - as driving examples
    - large data (more generally)
        - data cannot fit in VRAM or even RAM
        - points, images may be the most important (other layers may be less important)
        - tracks may be next in priority (e.g. for cell migration, animal behavior)
    - dask computed data
        - good inspiration for similar use cases
    - neuroglancer: load 50-200TB
        - vv large EM 3D dataset (mostly 2D browsing)
        - cloudvolume and tensorstore are libraries with available APIs to load this data (array-like)
        - prob too large for persistent storage on most machines
        - has to be multi-scale
        - would also benefit ortho views (though not required)
        - datasets are chunked
            - could be aware of data source
        - good stretch use case to bring all 3 categories together
        - there are EM volumes with associated point sets (e.g. synapses)
    - live video streaming in acq projects
        - e.g. from ffmpeg
        - frames can be lost/dropped
        - wait for a frame to be available (kind of similar to a cache hit/miss)
        - may want to process the data, either for visualization only, or also for storage
        - not required (possible now, and other people have done something similar with zarr, which is not ideal or performant)
- [Greg]: transform updates
    - some special handling for diagonal and permutation matrices
    - set_slice: how is this consumed by vispy
    - see WIP: https://github.com/napari/napari/compare/main...grlee77:add-transform-permutations?expand=1
- [Andy]: alternative approach to deprecating `Layer.text`
    - https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari/pull/3/files
    - more generally, how to change a field from a single value to encoding (e.g. color)
    - maybe for next time?
- [Andy]: made updates to properties -> features example: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4218
    - maybe for next time?


### Action items

- Jun, Andy: may share updates to goals/use-cases
- Andy: review missed items from last time
