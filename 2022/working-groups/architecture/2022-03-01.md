### Agenda

- [Andy]: `current_properties` vs. `feature_defaults`, fight!
    - see [#4064](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4064) for some existing discussion. 
    - some notes/ideas: https://hackmd.io/8rvb-ql_RAWA2MyPzFwcmQ
    - should selection of points and shapes move to use evented selection model?
    - add setter for feature defaults
    - don't update the features for current selection when updating feature_defaults (in contrast to current_properties)
    - provide a recipe / example script showing how to update features for currently-selected points/shapes
- [Andy]: high level project plan for layer/data/async
    - see WIP notes: https://hackmd.io/6ZF6rgzNSHuj6hd3LS2vJg

### Action items

- [Andy]: implement `feature_defaults` setter with event
    - Do not include selection-dependent side effect for setter
    - But do modify `feature_defaults` when selection changes.
- [Andy]: continue writing up layer/data/slice project description and share more widely after defining initial goals
