### Agenda

- [Andy]: layer slice pure refactor
    - https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari/pull/24
    - not directly tied to async slicing, but may help support/simplify it
    - looking for feedback and questions
    - better ideas for names?
    - Juan: +1 to this PR
        - Push on other parts of layer instance to group and refactor (maybe 3+4 together)
            1. Slice/render state
            2. Data source (e.g. `data`, `_transforms`, `features`)
            3. Other vispy node dependent-data (e.g. `Points.face_color`)
            4. Vispy node properties (e.g. `opacity`)
            5. Selection of layer elements
        - `corner_pixels`: ideally would be related to the highest-resolution level
        - For now, incorporate `corner_pixels` and `data_level` into `_SliceInput`, so they are grouped together
- [Andy]: tried view-driven (instead of model-driven) async
    - https://github.com/andy-sweet/napari/compare/async-slice-proto...andy-sweet:napari:async-slice-proto-alt
    - did not love it
    - other things to try?
    - are we comfortable making a model driven async proposal? if so, what API to force sync?
    - Juan: not breaking existing usage of things like `current_step` is a good motivator to make that represent the last response
        - At least the entry points in the API should cause synchronous behaviors

### Action items

- [Juan]: read NAP
- [Andy]: get PR up for review
