### Agenda

- Standard python multi-threading packages
    - Still recommended to go ahead with concurrent.futures
- Zulip thread: millions/billions of points
    - Motivation for async and LOD for points layer (and others)
    - Limited field of view and finite queries could also help here (even before async and LOD)

### Action items

- Andy: understand/diagram how transforms and slicing interact
