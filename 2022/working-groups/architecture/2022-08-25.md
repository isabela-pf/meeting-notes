### Agenda

- [Andy]: async slicing proto with labels
    - Tried to refactor raw_to_displayed, but stopped at `Labels._lookup_with_index`
    - Can workaround this by using BC state stored from `Layer._set_slice`, which should work for now
- [Eric]: representative examples of image data
    - Kyle has some familiarity with these, so can help out
    - Get in 2 or 3 representative datasets as example scripts
    - Convert to ASV benchmarks later/soon for reproducible results
- [Eric/Grzegorz]: labels colormapping
    - [Zulip topic](https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/212875-general/topic/labels.20.28direct.29)
    - Eric: we're (mis)using vispy (continuous) colormaps for discrete colormaps
    - Grzegorz: alternative solution may provide a simple/fast solution for a few hundred colors
    - What is blocking the shader colormap work?
        - Need to fix after catching up with main 
        - Needs some more refactoring + clean up
        - Other issue related to mutable `AVAILABLE_COLORMAPS`
        - Slightly impeded by Open 2.1 (i.e. newer version would make things easier and relate more to example code. Old Intel iGPUs won't really support SL past this (may also be macOS related?).
- Grzegorz: https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4982
    - Any ideas around recent changes?
    

### Action items

- Eric: open a PR with example scripts
    - Kyle to assist
- Andy/Kim: pure refactor
- Andy/Grzegorz: follow-up with https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4982
