### Agenda

- Complex execution of ViewerModel
    - some changes (e.g. moving a layer in a layer list) may take a long time
        - interactions with QWidgets need to happen on main thread
    - plugin may reorder layers on a background thread
        - note that returned (etc.) event will execute callbacks on main thread
        - do we want to support things like modifying the viewermodel on a non-main thread
    - stronger documentation around recommendations
    - can we have some automation around background thread access to napari objects?
        - similar to private API access
        - automate a warning
        - automate grabbing a lock?
    
- Events and related bugs
    - Ordering of callbacks
        - layer list ordering: https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4421
            - magicgui always adds to the top
            - callback is added to the front of the callback list
                - should default be end of list?
    - documentation is lacking around events
        - nothing about position
        - hard to find detailed docs (i.e. in docstrings) even for experienced napari developers
        - adding developer guide at top of or next to events reference in in-depth explanation
        - who should write these types of developer guides?
            - developers? someone with a fresh perspective?
            - at least have someone with a new perspective to read the docs

### Action items

- Andy: communicate with docs working group about prioritizing core/architecture dev docs (e.g. events)
