### Agenda

- Review action items from last time
- [Andy]: project boards
- Permutation review?: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4303
- [Andy]: Async updates/questions
    - tools for understanding when the GIL is released 
        - from vaex author: https://www.maartenbreddels.com/perf/jupyter/python/tracing/gil/2021/01/14/Tracing-the-Python-GIL.html
        - using dis: https://opensource.com/article/17/4/grok-gil
        - more info: https://callhub.io/understanding-python-gil/
        - cython in scikit-image: marking nogil in cython code
            - may not always actually release the gil?
            - also with gil context for acquiring temporarily
            - e.g. scikit-image rank does run in parallel
    - maybe points-specific optimizations (with integer coordinates)
    - starting/joining threads may have some overhead: avoid when possible
    - GIL behavior may change between Python versions

### Action items

- Greg: address comments, ping Juan
