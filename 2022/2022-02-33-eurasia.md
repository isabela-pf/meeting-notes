## action items from last meeting

- Lorenzo: some PRs in need of feedback
    - thick slices: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4012
    - line visuals: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4005
- Gen: Labels annotation capabilities in napari
  - MIB "microscopy image browser" http://mib.helsinki.fi/ MIB has some nice features napari doesn't, including:
    - superpixel annotation (watershed and graphcut options) http://mib.helsinki.fi/help/main2/ug_gui_menu_tools_watershed.html 
        - Kevin: Constantine Pape is working on a GUI for his mutex watershed (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12717) that likely has some superpixel capabilities (plugin accelerator grant)
    - shape interpolation between slices (this turned out to be more useful than superpixels for me personally)
    - would be good to make a napari plugin to do these things
    - Kevin: many of these things would be helpful for me, happy to chat about collaborating on them if they are also useful to you
