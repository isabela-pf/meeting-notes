### Code of conduct
We strive to make the napari community a welcoming place! As such, the napari code of conduct applies to all community events. Please take a moment to review our [our code of conduct and incident reporting process](https://napari.org/stable/community/code_of_conduct.html).


### Agenda
- Chi-Li Chiu: request for feedback on metadata handling
    - [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10VpJrqXq4JiCLsk6zDycihe3FbZr7TE6zQfwSM6hDDU/edit?usp=sharing) - please see slide 13 as well!
    - [job stories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WHcP80f8dlgiC_6K5hsqm6O-nXf-bxQZovFzM99xX8/edit?usp=sharing)
- Grzegorz Bokota: higlight labels based release notes [5061](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5061)
- Andy Sweet: 0.4.17 update
    - Decision: remove 0.4.17 milestone from #5006
        - If we feel confident enough, we could bring this into a later RC.
        - It may be difficult to create a 0.4.18 with this as it has many changes, though may be worthwhile.
- Andy Sweet: last(ish) call for comments/objections on [async slicing NAP](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/5052)


### Action items

- Andy Sweet: push release notes draft and ask for highlight copy from respective main authors.
