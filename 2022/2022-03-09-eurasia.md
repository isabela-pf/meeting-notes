## action items from last meeting

- Lorenzo: some PRs in need of feedback
    - thick slices: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4012
    - line visuals: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4005
- Gen: Labels annotation capabilities in napari
  - MIB "microscopy image browser" http://mib.helsinki.fi/ MIB has some nice features napari doesn't, including:
    - superpixel annotation (watershed and graphcut options) http://mib.helsinki.fi/help/main2/ug_gui_menu_tools_watershed.html 
        - Kevin: Constantine Pape is working on a GUI for his mutex watershed (https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12717) that likely has some superpixel capabilities (plugin accelerator grant)
    - shape interpolation between slices (this turned out to be more useful than superpixels for me personally)
    - would be good to make a napari plugin to do these things
    - Kevin: many of these things would be helpful for me, happy to chat about collaborating on them if they are also useful to you


## Agenda

- Juan: 0.4.15rc3
- Juan: git-lfs. If you run into issues with git clone, pull, or push, try setting [GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1](https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/212875-general/topic/lfs/near/274621016) before the git operation.
- Robert: [devbio-napari](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/devbio-napari#installation) Intro in Dresden
    - ~Fixed dependencies slowly updated
    - might be fixed medium term by conda-forge bundle
    - napari bundle might pin common dependencies like PyTorch, TF, NumPy, etc.
    - Volker: Jupyter Desktop is a good central solution for napari
- Varuun: Recording demo for plugin than doing it live for the plugin talks for the Napari plugin acccelerator grant presentations
    - We all think videos are fine.
    - Authoritative source for such questions is sciencegrants@chanzuckerberg.com
- Kushaan: pretty pictures
    - Ideas for segmenting astrocytes:
        - Use Ilastik to find the astrocytes
        - Use high-sigma gaussian blur to find astrocyte centers
        - then watershed
- Volker: question regarding error messages, can show a quick demo (grid fit) time allowing.
- Robert: [CZI EOSS cycle 5 is announced.](https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/). Apply!
- {Anyone: insert your agenda items above this line}
