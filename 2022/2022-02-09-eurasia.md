## Agenda

- naparicon
- Robert: Napari plugins for surface / point cloud processing are taking shape (pun intended)
  - https://github.com/zacsimile/napari-pymeshlab/issues
  - https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces
  - fix lighting and "dark side" rendering in surfaces would be cool
  - kevin says: trimesh has been working well for us to process meshes https://trimsh.org/trimesh.html
  - Genevieve says: An interesting paper I read recently related to surface meshes is Ben Barad's paper on his surface morphometrics toolkit https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.23.477440v3
  - There's a github repo too -     https://github.com/GrotjahnLab/surface_morphometrics
  - Lorenzo: have single lighting source for all layers synchronised
- Robert: skeletonization, where are the plugins?
  - Juan: happy to chat with users, https://meet.jni.codes
- Kevin: skeleton to spline:
    - https://github.com/kevinyamauchi/splineslicer
- Alister: dask-ification of plugin code. Project suggested by Jacob Tomlinson https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-ctl 
  - Allow dask-based plugins to run on institutional clusters by default.
  - using dask-ctl which allows for cluster creation from yaml files
- Robert: dask tutorial, can people more familiar with dask proofread: https://haesleinhuepf.github.io/BioImageAnalysisNotebooks/32_tiled_image_processing/tiling_images.html
- Alister: Tiler project
  - Github repo: https://github.com/the-lay/tiler
  - napari plugin for tiler https://github.com/tdmorello/napari-tiler
- Gen: Labels annotation capabilities in napari
  - MIB "microscopy image browser" http://mib.helsinki.fi/ MIB has some nice features napari doesn't, including:
    - superpixel annotation (watershed and graphcut options) http://mib.helsinki.fi/help/main2/ug_gui_menu_tools_watershed.html 
    - shape interpolation between slices (this turned out to be more useful than superpixels for me personally)
    - would be good to make a napari plugin to do these things
- Lorenzo: some PRs in need of feedback
    - thick slices: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4012
    - line visuals: https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/4005
